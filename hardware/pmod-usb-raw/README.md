# USB PMOD

This is a raw USB pmod with an LED and pullup.  It's designed to work with
the TinyFPGA Bootloader but could be used for any project that bitbangs usb.

It has both USB Micro and USB Mini, you only need one or the other.  It also has power LEDs for both the USB connection and the PMOD connection.  On the underside it has a LED driven by one of the PMOD pins.

See the bootloader at https://github.com/tinyfpga/TinyFPGA-Bootloader
